We love additions to the list of Idaho tech meetups/groups! 

Please submit pull requests with any changes you'd like to make, especially to [groups.json](groups.json).

Groups listed in [groups.json](groups.json) should:

- Focus on creating things using technology in Idaho
- Have Idaho basis (based in Idaho or on the border.) Livestream/video-conference/Slack/IRC meetings with Idaho basis are good too!
- Should use meetup.com, EventBrite, or iCal/ics URL, for event scheduling so https://gemstate.io can work its magic. Facebook groups, whether public or private, are no longer supported, since the API's been closed but to Facebook partners for years now.
- Should have a URL explaining what the group's about (a meetup.com or Facebook URL often suffices for this)
- Should have a Code of Conduct so people understand what the group considers acceptable inclusive behavior. This should be easily discoverable at the URL.
