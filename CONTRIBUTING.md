We love additions to the list of Idaho tech meetups/groups! 

Please submit pull requests with any changes you'd like to make, especially to [groups.json](groups.json).

Groups listed in [groups.json](groups.json) should:

- Focus on creating things using technology in Idaho
- Have Idaho basis (the educators/presenters/mentors are based in Idaho, or in a border town or metro, namely Spokane.) If meetings are in-person, these should be in Idaho or border town/metro. Livestream/video-conference/Slack/IRC groups with Idaho basis are good too!
- Should use HTTPS [iCal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) URL, meetup.com, EventBrite, or Sched for event scheduling so [gemstate.io](gemstate.io) can work its magic. Facebook groups, whether public or private, are no longer supported, since the events API's been closed but to Facebook partners for years now.
- Should have a URL explaining what the group's about (a meetup.com or Facebook URL suffices for this if there's nothing else)
- Should have a Code of Conduct so people understand what the group considers acceptable inclusive behavior. This should be easily discoverable at the URL.
