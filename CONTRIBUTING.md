We love additions to the list of Idaho tech meetups/groups! 

Please submit pull requests with any changes you'd like to make, especially to [groups.json](groups.json).

Groups listed in [groups.json](groups.json) should:

- Focus on creating things using technology in Idaho
- Have Idaho basis (based in Idaho or on the border.) Livestream/video-conference/Slack/IRC meetings with Idaho basis are good too!
- Should use public Meetup.com or public Facebook group for event scheduling so http://gemstate.io can work its magic (an iCalendar/ics URL also works, but doesn't support RSVP yet)
- Must have a URL explaining what the group's about (a Meetup.com/Facebook URL often suffices for this)
- Should have a Code of Conduct so people understand what the group considers acceptable inclusive behavior. This should be easily discoverable at the URL.
