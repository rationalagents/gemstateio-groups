# gemstateio-groups

gemstateio-groups is/was used by [gemstate.io](https://gemstate.io) to identify tech-creative groups, meetups, events, and conferences in Idaho. gemstate.io aggregated corresponding events into a single website calendar, published them to [Idaho Tech Slack](https://idahotech.community/).

gemstate.io will shut down March 12 2021 to make room for new things. After that I'm not making further updates to gemstateio-groups. I'll accept PRs. If I find it's getting notably stale - e.g. pointing to meetup.com groups that no longer exist, few/no PRs - I'll archive it near end of 2021. *-waded*

The initial list of groups came from Idaho Tech Council's "Local Places For Techies To Network." Thanks to others who've sent us tips about new groups across the state.
