# gemstateio-groups

## Big picture

gemstate.io's mission is fostering connections between people creating things with technology in Idaho. We want to see people doing great things everywhere in Idaho, and they needn't do it alone.

gemstateio-groups is a dataset the https://gemstate.io agent treats as authoriative about names, locations, & URLs of creator groups.

## Edit the data!

Groups listed here:

- Focus on creating things using technology in Idaho (e.g. specific-technology user groups, hack nights, initiative groups, continuing education, conferences, and tech-business groups)
- Must have Idaho basis (based in Idaho, or are on the Idaho border.) Regular livestream/video-conference/Slack/IRC hangouts with Idaho basis are accepted too!
- Must have a URL explaining why/when/what
- Should use one of the schema-listed technologies for event scheduling (e.g. Facebook) so gemstate.io can work its magic
- Should have a Code of Conduct so people understand what your group considers acceptable inclusive behavior.
