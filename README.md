# gemstateio-groups

## Big picture

gemstate.io's mission is fostering connections between people creating things with technology in Idaho.

gemstateio-groups is the dataset the gemstate.io agent treats as authoriative about group names, locations, & event streams.

## Contributing

To spread knowledge about a group or update a group's information please submit a pull request against [groups.csv](https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/blob/master/groups.csv). See [groups-schema.json](https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/blob/master/groups-schema.json) for help with the schema.

Groups listed here:

- Focus on creating things using technology in Idaho
- Have Idaho basis (based in Idaho or on the border.) Livestream/video-conference/Slack/IRC meetings with Idaho basis are good too!
- Should use Meetup.com or Facebook public page for event scheduling so http://gemstate.io can work its magic (an iCalendar/ics URL also works)
- Must have a URL explaining why/when/what (if the Meetup.com or Facebook public page don't)
- Should have a Code of Conduct so people understand what the group considers acceptable inclusive behavior. This should be easily discoverable at the URL.
