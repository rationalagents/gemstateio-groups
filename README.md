# gemstateio-groups
Idaho tech meetup data with purpose, location, frequency, and more

## Mission
gemstate.io's mission is to foster connections between people creating things with technology in Idaho. 

gemstateio-groups feeds the mission by providing updated and comprehensive data on tech meetups/conferences/hackathons happening in Idaho. We want people meeting and doing great things with reckless abandon.

Reckful abandon is also OK.

## Get the data!

See [groups.csv](https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/blob/master/groups.csv). The schema is [groups-schema.json](https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/blob/master/groups-schema.json).

Groups listed here:

- focus on creating things using technology in Idaho (e.g. hacknights, specific-technology meetups or user groups, initiative groups, continuing education, conferences)
- held 1 meeting already <sup>1</sup>
- have a URL explaining when future meetings are, or who can be contacted 
- have Idaho basis or border (Pullman, Spokane) basis

Livestream/video-conference-only events with Idaho basis are great too!
