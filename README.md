## Mission
gemstate.io's mission is fostering connections between people creating things with technology in Idaho. 

gemstateio-groups provides data on tech meetups/workgrounds/conferences/hackathons that the website/agents use as a source when helping people connect.

We want to see people doing great things in Idaho, and they needn't do it alone. 

## Edit the data!

See [groups.csv](https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/blob/master/groups.csv). The schema is [groups-schema.json](https://github.com/waded/gemstateio-groups/blob/master/groups-schema.json), which explains the meaning of some of the columns, and helps keep the data valid (try http://csvlint.io.)

Groups listed here:

- focus on creating things using technology in Idaho (e.g. hackathons, specific-technology user groups, initiative groups, continuing education, conferences, and tech-business groups)
- have a URL explaining when future meetings are (or at minimum some contact point)
- have Idaho basis (are either based in Idaho, or are on the Idaho border, for example in Pullman, Spokane Valley, or Ontario.)

Livestream/video-conference-only events with Idaho basis are great too, and we encourage groups that aren't doing this today to try it!

## Contributing

The initial list of groups came from Idaho Tech Council's "Local Places For Techies To Network." For a minimally-viable time http://gemstate.io was just a short link to ITC's page at [@jdmullin](http://twitter.com/jdmullin)'s suggestion.
