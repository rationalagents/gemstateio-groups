# gemstateio-groups

gemstateio-groups was used by website/service gemstate.io to identify tech-creative groups, meetups, events, and conferences in Idaho. gemstate.io aggregated events into a single calendar, published them to [Idaho Tech Slack](https://idahotech.community/), and kept record of groups that'd disappeared/moved.

See [groups.json](groups.json) and [its schema](groups.schema.json). groups.json is validated against the schema: [![](https://circleci.com/gh/rationalagents/gemstateio-groups.png?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/rationalagents/gemstateio-groups)

## Deprecation/archive warning

gemstate.io, launched in 2015, shut down March 2021 to make room for new things. I'm not making further updates to gemstateio-groups, but I'll accept PRs. If I find gemstateio-groups becomes notably stale - e.g. pointing to meetup.com groups that no longer exist, something that gemstate.io defended against - I'll archive it December 2021. If you want to take on maintenance/ownership, build something serious based on this, let me know well in advance. *-waded+gsioprune@rationalagents.com*

The initial list of groups came from Idaho Tech Council's "Local Places For Techies To Network." Thanks to others who've sent us tips about new groups across the state.
