# gemstateio-groups

[gemstate.io](http://gemstate.io)'s mission is connecting people that create with technology in Idaho.

gemstateio-groups is the dataset the gemstate.io apps use for group names, locations, and events. 
See [groups.json](groups.json) and [the schema](groups.schema.json)

If you'd like to use this dataset in your own project, please do! It's public domain under [CC0](LICENSE).

## groups.csv is deprecated

Although the dataset was originally in CSV format, we're switching to
JSON, allowing for future extension and making changes easier to review. 
groups.csv is being frozen for changes effective immediately, and will be
removed March 1 2019. Please submit PR to add/edit groups.json instead.
