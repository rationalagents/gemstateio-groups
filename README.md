# gemstateio-groups

[gemstate.io](https://www.gemstate.io)'s mission is connecting people that create with 
technology in Idaho.

gemstateio-groups is the data the gemstate.io apps use for group names, locations, and events. 
See [groups.json] and [its schema](groups.schema.json).

If you'd like to use this data in your own project, please do! It's public domain under [CC0](LICENSE).

## groups.csv is deprecated

Although the data was originally in CSV format, we're switching to
JSON, allowing for future extension and making changes easier to review. 
groups.csv is frozen for changes effective immediately and we're removing
it in March 2019. Please make your changes to [groups.json] instead.
