# gemstateio-groups

gemstateio-groups is/was used by [gemstate.io](https://gemstate.io) to identify related groups, meetups, events, conferences, and their organizers in Idaho.

gemstate.io will shut down March 12 2021. After that I'm not going to make further updates to gemstateio-groups myself. I'll accept PRs. If I find it's getting notably stale - e.g. pointing to meetup.com groups that no longer exist, few/no PRs - I'll archive it near end of 2021. *-waded*
