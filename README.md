# gemstateio-groups

gemstateio-groups was used by website/service gemstate.io to identify tech-creative groups, meetups, events, and conferences in Idaho. gemstate.io aggregated events into a single calendar, published them to [Idaho Tech Slack](https://idahotech.community/), and kept record of groups that'd disappeared/moved.

See [groups.json](groups.json) and [its schema](groups.schema.json). groups.json is validated against the schema: [![](https://circleci.com/gh/rationalagents/gemstateio-groups.png?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/rationalagents/gemstateio-groups)

## Deprecation/archive warning

gemstate.io, launched in 2015, shut down March 2021 to make room for new things. So, I'm not making further updates to gemstateio-groups, and the data's gone stale (it certainly points to groups that no longer exist, something gemstate.io defended against.) If you want to take on ownership let me know.

The initial list of groups came from Idaho Tech Council's "Local Places For Techies To Network." Thanks to others who've sent us tips about new groups across the state.
